# Fox Multitool

## We didn't design Fox Multitool just for gamers, but for everyone.
Fox Multitool isn't any normal launcher, It's a Community of Developers.


### Is Fox Multitool out now?
No, not yet. but soon will be.

### What does it do?
It helps people make games, play them, modify them, even create something that isn't a game!

### Can anyone make anything that could harm my computer?
No, if you manage to, we will take the project down and perm ban you.

### Is Fox Multitool Paid software?
No, and never will be.

### How many people work on Fox Multitool?
Two. It's hard working on the project because of that.

### Fox Multitool got a virus on my computer!
If that happens then we're either hacked or you didn't go to the correct website.

### This looks like a virus. proof it's not?
We don't have that yet. (I just wrote this as i was developing the first prototype!)

### Release Date?
Hopefully: 8/30/2022
If not then: 9/12/2022 if I had to guess.
